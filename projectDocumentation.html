            <h2>Introduction to Sunrise</h2>
            <p>Sunrise is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing 
				affordable housing for senior citizens. The organization is subsidized
				by the government, allowing residents to pay rent based on their 
				income levels. Sunrise operates two buildings located on the same
				property: <strong>Sunrise Seniors Place (SSP)</strong> and 
				<strong>Sunrise Place Co-op (SPC)</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>SSP</strong> is managed by a property manager, with its
				board of governors comprising both residents of the building and 
				individuals from outside the community. In contrast, <strong>SPC</strong>
				is entirely managed by its residents, including its board of governors.
				Both buildings follow an independent living model, encouraging 
				residents to form friendships and build a supportive community
				with their neighbors.</p>

            <h2>Project Objective</h2>
            <p>The objective of this project is to apply web design and development skills by creating a demonstration website tailored to the needs of a non-profit organization or small business. The website will simulate a real-world project, showcasing the ability to meet specific organizational needs while adhering to criteria designed for functionality, simplicity, and user navigation.</p>
        </section>
			<section id="project-description" class="section">
				<h2>Project Description</h2>
				<p>The project involves designing and developing a functional website that demonstrates the ability to address the potential needs of a non-profit organization or small business. Although the project is hypothetical, the website will be modeled as if it were for a real organization or business. The design must meet specific criteria, emphasizing simplicity, ease of navigation, and functionality.</p>

            <h2>Project Outcome: Improving Clarity and Functionality</h2>
            <ul>
					<li><strong>Clear Separation Between Buildings:</strong>
						<p>The current website combines information about both buildings on the same pages, which can sometimes create confusion. The redesigned website ensures that each building has its own dedicated page, clearly presenting relevant information. Additionally, a homepage introduces the organization as a whole and provides an overview of the two buildings.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Consistent and Neutral Design:</strong> 
						<p>To ensure fairness and avoid the perception that one building is prioritized over the other, the design employs neutral color schemes and similar layouts for both buildings. </p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Inclusion of Floor Plans:</strong>
						<p>Recognizing that the primary purpose of the organization is to provide housing, the new website includes a section for floor plans for both buildings. This addition aligns with user needs and provides essential information that was missing from the previous website.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Enhanced Accessibility for Elderly Users:</strong>
						<p>The redesigned website improves color contrast, making it more user-friendly for elderly visitors. This ensures better readability and accessibility for the primary audience of the organization.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Streamlined Navigation:</strong>
					<p>The new design simplifies navigation by consolidating relevant information onto single pages for each building. Users no longer need to visit multiple pages to find specific details, making the browsing experience more efficient and user-focused.</p>
					</li>
            </ul>
